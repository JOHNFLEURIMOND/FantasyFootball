rm -rf package-lock.json && rm -rf node_modules && npm install -g npm-check-updates && ncu -u && npm install && npm ls ajv && npm install --save-dev ajv@^8
```

### :heavy_plus_sign::heavy_plus_sign: Merging Code :heavy_plus_sign::heavy_plus_sign:

1. **Check Your Current Branch:**
   List all branches and check your current branch:

   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

   If you need to create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b {{name-of-your-branch}}
   ```

2. **Add and Commit Your Changes:**
   Add and commit your work:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "{{explain your changes}}"
   git push
   ```

3. **Fetch and Pull Updates:**
   Fetch and pull all changes from remote branches:

   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   git pull --all
   ```

4. **Merge or Rebase:**
   Merge changes from the main branch to your branch:

   ```bash
   git merge main
   ```

   Alternatively, you can rebase:

   ```bash
   git rebase main
   ```

   **Important:** Resolve any conflicts that arise, accept the incoming changes as needed, and commit the resolved changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Merged main branch into current branch"
   git push
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "Merged main branch into current branch" && git push

## How It Works:white_check_mark::

The application provides real-time fantasy football news and player projections, utilizing React for the frontend and Express for the backend. It interacts with the Sportsdata.io API to fetch data, which is then displayed through a user-friendly interface with Semantic UI and styled-components.
